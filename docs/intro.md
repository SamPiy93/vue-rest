# Vue Rest Docs

The vue-rest plugin was developed to help in VueJS applications that needs API request to do CRUD operations.

It implements two mixins: ApiList and ApiForm, and a prototype: $api.

I believe through this mixins you will be able to implement easily any CRUD that you need.

You're welcome to contribute to the project.
